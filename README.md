# Text_Segmentation_in_Image

This was my final year project in which the task was to perform text segmentation in images using autoencoders. 

KAIST Text Scene Database was used for training purpose. The code is written in tensorflow 2.0 along with libraries like matplotlib, numpy, opencv, scikit-learn.
